# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Betslip Conversion Website is a web application that enables users to convert betslip codes from one bookmaker to another (e.g., from Bet9ja to Sportybet) by automatically extracting betting selections, finding equivalent markets on the destination bookmaker, and generating a new betslip code with matching odds. The system uses browser automation via the browser-use library to scrape betslip details and simulate betslip creation across different bookmaker platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a bettor, I want to input a betslip code from my preferred bookmaker and select a destination bookmaker, so that I can get an equivalent betslip on a different platform without manually recreating my selections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a form with fields for betslip code input and bookmaker selection dropdowns
2. WHEN a user enters a valid betslip code THEN the system SHALL accept alphanumeric codes of varying lengths
3. WHEN a user selects source and destination bookmakers THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown options including Bet9ja, Sportybet, Betway, and Bet365
4. WHEN a user submits the conversion request THEN the system SHALL validate that source and destination bookmakers are different
5. WHEN the form is submitted with valid data THEN the system SHALL initiate the conversion process and display a loading indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a bettor, I want the system to automatically extract my betting selections from the source bookmaker, so that I don't have to manually input each game and market.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a betslip code is submitted THEN the system SHALL use browser automation to navigate to the source bookmaker's website
2. WHEN the browser automation accesses the betslip page THEN the system SHALL input the provided betslip code into the appropriate field
3. WHEN the betslip is loaded THEN the system SHALL extract game names, betting markets, and odds for each selection
4. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL return structured data containing all betting selections
5. IF the betslip code is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the issue
6. WHEN anti-bot protections are encountered THEN the system SHALL attempt to bypass them using stealth techniques

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a bettor, I want the system to find equivalent betting markets on my destination bookmaker, so that my converted betslip maintains the same betting intent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN betting selections are extracted THEN the system SHALL normalize game names to handle variations in team naming conventions
2. WHEN searching for equivalent markets THEN the system SHALL map betting markets using predefined conversion tables (e.g., "1X2" to "Match Result")
3. WHEN comparing odds THEN the system SHALL accept odds within a tolerance range of Â±0.05 to account for natural variations
4. WHEN a game is found on the destination bookmaker THEN the system SHALL verify the event has not started
5. IF a game or market is unavailable THEN the system SHALL flag it for partial conversion handling
6. WHEN all available matches are found THEN the system SHALL proceed to betslip creation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a bettor, I want the system to automatically create a new betslip on my destination bookmaker, so that I can place my bets without manual recreation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN equivalent selections are identified THEN the system SHALL use browser automation to navigate to the destination bookmaker's betting page
2. WHEN on the destination site THEN the system SHALL search for and select each identified game and market
3. WHEN selections are added THEN the system SHALL simulate the betslip creation process
4. WHEN the betslip is created THEN the system SHALL extract the generated betslip code
5. IF betslip creation fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before reporting failure
6. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL return the new betslip code along with selection details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a bettor, I want to see the results of my betslip conversion including any warnings or issues, so that I can understand what was successfully converted and what requires my attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion is successful THEN the system SHALL display the new betslip code prominently
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show a comparison table of original vs converted selections with game names, markets, and odds
3. WHEN partial conversion occurs THEN the system SHALL display warnings for unavailable games or markets
4. WHEN odds differ significantly THEN the system SHALL highlight odds variations that exceed the tolerance range
5. IF conversion fails completely THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with suggested next steps
6. WHEN results are shown THEN the system SHALL provide options to copy the new betslip code or start a new conversion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback, so that users understand issues and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry failed requests up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN bookmaker sites are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display maintenance messages and suggest trying again later
3. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement delays and queue requests appropriately
4. WHEN browser automation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. IF anti-bot measures block access THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative approaches or notify users of temporary unavailability
6. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL never expose sensitive internal information to users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a bettor, I want the conversion process to complete quickly, so that I can place my bets while odds are still favorable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversion is initiated THEN the system SHALL complete the process within 30 seconds for standard betslips
2. WHEN processing multiple selections THEN the system SHALL use parallel browser automation where possible
3. WHEN caching is available THEN the system SHALL use cached game mappings to speed up conversions
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide estimated wait times
5. IF conversion takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates to the user
6. WHEN optimization is possible THEN the system SHALL prioritize frequently converted bookmaker pairs

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to operate within legal and ethical boundaries, so that the service remains compliant with bookmaker terms and gambling regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing bookmaker sites THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt files and rate limiting
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL not persist sensitive betslip codes beyond the conversion session
3. WHEN providing conversion services THEN the system SHALL include disclaimers about accuracy and user responsibility
4. WHEN operating in different regions THEN the system SHALL comply with local gambling laws and regulations
5. IF terms of service violations are detected THEN the system SHALL implement measures to ensure compliance
6. WHEN user privacy is concerned THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data protection measures
